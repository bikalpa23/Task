                    <p>The primary purpose of collecting information from you is to be able to communicate with you – in
                        the event you contact us or are interested in an app review or advertising. Generally, AppGames
                        collects information in three ways: (1) When you email us (2) Using our Contact form (3) If you
                        submitted your app game for review We also collect personal information if you report a problem
                        with our services. If you contact AppGames, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
                        Wherever AppGames collects personal information we make an effort to include a link to this
                        Privacy Policy on that page.

                    <h1>What are “cookies?”</h1>
                    <p>Data collection devices, such as “cookies,” are used to store, and sometimes track, information
                        about you. Generally, these cookies help provide personalized services and promote trust and
                        safety. A cookie is a small file containing a small amount of data that is sent to your browser
                        from a web server and placed on your computer’s hard drive to assist us in providing our
                        services. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them and are unable to execute any
                        code or virus. Most cookies are “session cookies,” and are automatically deleted from your hard
                        drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if you wish and if
                        your browser permits.

                        For many users accessing the Internet, the IP address will be different every time you log on.
                        We record the IP Addresses that access AppGames.com along with related information such as your
                        browser type and operating system. This information helps us, in part, learn about the

                        accounts)
                        may be gathered in a non-personally identifiable form to build higher quality, more useful

                        and services of the Site. Aggregate data may be disclosed in a non-personally identifiable
                        manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes.
                        However, no personal information that could be used to identify you personally is disclosed in
                        these situations.<br><br>

                        External Service Providers: Separate services are offered by third parties, also known as
                        external service providers, some of whom advertise on the Site. If you choose to use these
                        services, disclose information to these parties, and/or grant them permission to collect
                        information about you, their privacy policy governs the use of your information.<br><br>

                        to a third party in the event of a sale or other transfer of assets or of any portion of our
                        business. In the event AppGames enters a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by
                        another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable
                        information may be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and prominent

                        information.<br><br>


                        We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the
                        information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be
                        violating AppGames’s Terms of Use Agreement (“User Agreement”) or may be causing injury to or
                        interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) AppGames’s rights or property, other
                        Site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. AppGames may disclose or
                        access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for
                        administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our
                        services.<br><br>


                        We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will
                        never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, we may be forced
                        to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third
                        parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may
